## Reading

Xailent [A comprehensive guide to Edge AI](https://xailient.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-edge-ai/)
    - Is neither comprehensive nor much about edge AI specific (very general). But do mention the difference between old AI processing (concentrated) vs. Edge AI (distributed). And good for getting keyword for further reading (TinyML). More of a hype article than a technical one.

AI at the Edge by Daniel Situnayake, Jenny Plunkett [Chapter 1 - A brief Introduction to Edge AI](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-at-the/9781098120191/ch01.html)
    - This one is very good, clean up terminology and give plenty of example, with promise for more (that I can not read). A very pleasant read.

This series is good that it deserves its own section. A lot of notable project with various tools and ideas (feature selection, Tensorflow, low-cost data acquisition, TinyML, edge AI anomaly detection). Videos that are especially notable are listed below:
