## Reading

Xailent [A comprehensive guide to Edge AI](https://xailient.com/blog/a-comprehensive-guide-to-edge-ai/)
    - Is neither comprehensive nor much about edge AI specific (very general). But do mention the difference between old AI processing (concentrated) vs. Edge AI (distributed). And good for getting keyword for further reading (TinyML). More of a hype article than a technical one.

AI at the Edge by Daniel Situnayake, Jenny Plunkett [Chapter 1 - A brief Introduction to Edge AI](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-at-the/9781098120191/ch01.html)
    - This one is very good, clean up terminology and give plenty of example, with promise for more (that I can not read). A very pleasant read.



## Video

### Digi-Key Youtube Channel [Shawn Hymel presents series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBQazB0HUySNug4eRm-73hNyMcCRViRB)

This series is good that it deserves its own section. A lot of notable project with various tools and ideas (feature selection, Tensorflow, low-cost data acquisition, TinyML, edge AI anomaly detection). Videos that are especially notable are listed below:

- [Intro to Edge AI: Machine Learning + IoT â€“ Maker.io Tutorial | Digi-Key Electronics](https://youtu.be/Ejld8XZmvwE)
    - Go through most of the same thing as AI at the Edge by Daniel Situnayake, Jenny Plunkett, better if you are a visual learner (or are lazy to read).

# TinyML

All About Circuit - [What Is TinyML?](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/what-is-tinyml/)

Jair Ribeiro - [What is TinyML, and why does it matter?](https://medium.com/tech-cult-heartbeat/what-is-tinyml-and-why-does-it-matter-f5b164766876)
    - Give more keyword and tools (PyTorch Mobile, CoreML).
    - Market forecast (and what not) from 2020.
